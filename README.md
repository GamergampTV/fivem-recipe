# fivem-recipe WIP

This is a basic esx server made for FiveM roleplay server. It uses es_extended 1.1 and not 1.2, unlike the Plume ESX build.

It's still used by some communities. Thus I want to make one.

If you want to commit, please make sure it works and submit a PR.

Also to add. I didn't make this from scratch. It's an edited version from PlumeESX which you may find [here](https://github.com/tabarra/PlumeESX-recipe).
