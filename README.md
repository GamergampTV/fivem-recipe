# fivem-recipe WIP

This is a basic esx server made for FiveM roleplay server. It uses es_extended 1.1 and not 1.2, unlike the Plume ESX build.
It's still used by some communities. Thus I want to make one.

This recipe is intended to run inside of [txAdmin](https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin).
If you are confused about anything. Take a look at the [Recipe Documentation](https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin/blob/master/docs/recipe.md).

Also to add. I didn't make this from scratch. It's an edited version from PlumeESX which you may find [here](https://github.com/tabarra/PlumeESX-recipe).
